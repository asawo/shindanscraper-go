# shindanscraper-go

Shindan scraper re-written in golang.

## What is it

This is a simple bot I created for learning purposes using golang and the [slack-go library](https://github.com/slack-go/slack).

Use the slash command `/shindan` to scrape and fetch the top 10 hot shindans from `https://shindanmaker.com/`.
